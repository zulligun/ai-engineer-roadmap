# Day 17 — End-to-End Logistic Regression Implementation

## Key Outcomes

- Built a complete end-to-end binary classification pipeline using logistic regression.
- Started with a small synthetic dataset and:
  - split it into training and validation sets
  - trained the model only on the training data
  - evaluated performance on unseen validation data
- Implemented logistic regression **from scratch**, including:
  - dot product
  - sigmoid function
  - gradient descent training
- Generated predicted probabilities and applied a threshold to convert them into class labels.
- Evaluated the model using:
  - accuracy
  - precision
  - recall
- All of this was implemented **without referring back to notes or examples** — a big milestone.
- This exercise reinforced that the same fundamentals scale directly to larger datasets and real-world ML systems.
